[05:47:17] <%mrnordstrom> You hit your shots on 128, they go where you aim :P
[05:47:33] <%mrnordstrom> ESEA servers feel better than faceit tho imo, don't know why
[05:48:03] <%SupremeTerrific> Yep, it feels so good in comparison. The first time I played 128 was when I was pretty serious about CS and I played godlike and I was just like "wtf where did this come from." Just the difference in tick, I guess. And a good game.

[06:00:07] <%mrnordstrom> Yeah I've dealt with music licenses. We had a project that required lyrics to songs. Even lyrics are expensive as fuck. Can imagine the lawsuits for a business like that. Tiresome.
[06:00:46] <%mrnordstrom> I built this sweet iPhone app where you could put song lyrics on images and stuff. It was fun.
[06:00:57] <%mrnordstrom> But licensing was hell.
[06:01:30] <%mrnordstrom> There's fair use tho, you can use snippets and stuff. But it's a grey zone.
[06:01:38] <%SupremeTerrific> I can't even imagine dealing with music licensing. Just the thought gives me a headache. lol
[06:02:02] <%mrnordstrom> Yeah Spotify has done a sick job negotiating to get all their music honestly.

[19:47:16] <%mrnordstrom> Cuz VLC has that option I need to tick to disable the "turn of monitor after X minutes" stuff while watching. So if VLC is in fullscreen. the monitor doesn't turn off.

[03:43:38] <%SupremeTerrific> There are some pretty damn good players in GN, tbh. People with well over 1k is the norm every match, who are skilled players but don't focus on team play, so are too inconsistent to rank up since the rank system changed.

[03:45:06] <%mrnordstrom> Match
[03:45:46] <%mrnordstrom> C9 vs compLexity should be a decent match
[03:46:00] <%SupremeTerrific> Yepp, for sure. I actually had a surprisingly good team one game earlier today, but we tied the damn game because of three rounds a couple of players just handed them because the bomb wasn't planted for them and they thought the defuse was faked. lol
[03:46:27] <%mrnordstrom> Yeh hah that kinda shit happens
[03:46:31] <%mrnordstrom> A lot
[03:46:57] <%SupremeTerrific> Literally three rounds in a row on T-side, with perfect executions, good lurk play to pick off their rotators, and then the guys on site would fail to hold and the lurker would be too far out of position.
[03:46:58] <%SupremeTerrific> It was rough.
[03:47:11] <%mrnordstrom> And dude I swear to god, say you play d2, you're CT and they plant B. Every single player pushes out and rapes you instead of holding angles on site. 
[03:47:20] <%SupremeTerrific> lol yes
[03:47:23] <%mrnordstrom> Damn heh
[03:47:37] <@%leanderb> Oh hello there
[03:47:42] <%SupremeTerrific> But I love holding CT or CT mid with the awp and just wait for the inevitable peeks.
[03:47:47] <@%jnthnxxx> HeyGuys
[03:47:50] <%mrnordstrom> 1v1, dude has an AWP, it's planted for tunnel. What does he do? Pushes out door and rapes me mid.

[03:48:00] <%SupremeTerrific> lol yep x)
[03:48:32] <%mrnordstrom> Had a nice retake ace tho. Teammates go like "whoah dude" lol
[03:49:08] <%SupremeTerrific> Oh, damn, that must have felt good. lol
[03:49:11] <%mrnordstrom> People just wanna play d2 in that rank tho...
[03:49:52] <%mrnordstrom> I love d2 personally, but I want a team I can trust.
[03:49:57] <%SupremeTerrific> Yeah, I usually turn off d2 and mirage after my first warm-up match, just so I can get a map I haven't played 10000 times.
[03:49:58] <%mrnordstrom> d2 and cache are my favs.
[03:50:05] <%mrnordstrom> Yeah
[03:50:45] <%SupremeTerrific> I really like cache, but I still have a lot to learn on it, despite playing it a lot. I haven't put in the time on nades, timings, etc. that I have on d2, mirage, cbble, etc.
[03:51:03] <%SupremeTerrific> That's probably why I'm still gold nova. Kappa
[03:51:04] <%mrnordstrom> Dank pop flashes on d2 are fun. Like CT, they plant A, you go up CT spawn and throw flash on the bump on the ground so it pops right up on site and blinds fucking everyone. Good stuff
[03:51:13] <%mrnordstrom> True, timings are so important
[03:51:20] <%SupremeTerrific> Oh, yeah, I love that flash.
[03:51:29] <@%jnthnxxx> twitch do not let me host proleague channels. im gonna try in a bit again FeelsBadMan
[03:51:33] <%mrnordstrom> You know that flash, but you're gold nova? wtf hah
[03:51:42] <%SupremeTerrific> I watch more than I play. Kappa
[03:51:43] <%mrnordstrom> jnthnxxx kk :(
[03:52:19] <%SupremeTerrific> I was DMG before the rank system changed. It's a pretty common story, really. I think most DMG/LE players are gold nova now.
[03:52:28] <%mrnordstrom> SupremeTerrific I sub to dazed's site, netcodeguides.com or whatever the URL is. Awesome shit. They go over timings on all maps, default setups, do demo reviews, it's so much to learn from.
[03:52:39] <%mrnordstrom> That said, I don't wanna advertise :P
[03:52:48] <%mrnordstrom> True that yes
[03:53:34] <%mrnordstrom> Like, on d2, if you have a good spawn for long, you get there 1 sec before the T, and can actually go straight to pit without them seeing you.
[03:53:43] <%SupremeTerrific> I'll probably wait until Fallen releases more of his stuff in English for free. I'm a cheap bastard. Kappa
[03:54:07] <%mrnordstrom> Same on mirage, good A spawn and you can get to A halls/palace before the T if you jump on the box instead of going on the ladder.
[03:54:21] <%SupremeTerrific> Oh, yep, I love it when I manage that, but hate when it happens to me. Kappa
[03:54:26] <%mrnordstrom> hah true, FalleN has some great stuff. His mirage smoke guide is nice.

[03:55:06] <@%jnthnxxx> finally
[03:55:26] <%mrnordstrom> And something that kinda tilts me is when I see people spam through the metal wall from CT to checkers. Spam through the wooden wall just next to the metal and you do a lot more damage.
[03:55:30] <%mrnordstrom> Oh nice
[03:56:09] <%mrnordstrom> Metal, well spammed with AWP and deagle. Not AK and M4.
[03:56:18] <%mrnordstrom> Unless you headshot.
[03:56:50] <%mrnordstrom> But the strategic stuff and things like timings and rotation guides are super interesting.
[03:57:33] <%mrnordstrom> Man, I've put way too much fucking time into this game. :o Don't know why.
[03:57:56] <@%leanderb> mrnordstrom, im nova
[03:57:57] <%SupremeTerrific> Oh, that reminds me...I got a fucked up kill on a B retake on cache. They'd smoked us out while we were about to enter from tree room. They flashed shortly after, so I just waited on top of the sandbags and took their pusher. Then dropped down, sent one burst through the smoke towards b-main after hearing them run that way and got an instant headshot. Then we cleaned the last two out of site and defused. Was amazing. FeelsGoodMan
[03:58:06] <@%leanderb> i know most dust 2 smokes and flashes OpieOP i just cant aim for shit OpieOP
[03:58:41] <%mrnordstrom> SupremeTerrific Hah, that's why I put so much time into it. That feeling when you do shit like that.

[21:51:25] <%mrnordstrom> They're all pretty tight.
[21:51:27] <bigfatgator> They should just reboot the entire team and leave f0rest or GTR or both

[21:55:27] <%mrnordstrom> I've never played h1
[21:55:27] <%Axelkic> one is like a mini-game

[21:55:35] <%Axelkic> 100 people enter, 1 person leaves
[21:55:40] <%Axelkic> and the survival version is like
[21:55:48] <%Axelkic> roleplaying, trying to not die, you have a thirst meter, hunger meter/etc
[21:56:00] <%mrnordstrom> Ah kk, interesting
[21:56:08] <%Axelkic> i think you can build forts in the survival version

[22:32:26] <dryljhon> yeah, i'm going to find job on september. maybe they give
[22:32:28] <bigfatgator> I call them several times every day when i wasnt able to install something, if something was damaged when i picked it up e.t.c

[22:33:29] <%mrnordstrom> bigfatgator I moved in with one of the hot chicks so I know ;) 4 year relationship
[22:33:42] <bigfatgator> From Jönköping?
[22:33:56] <%mrnordstrom> Nah England, when people started moving to Jönköping, we moved to Amsterdam
[22:33:57] <bigfatgator> Most grills i talked with are Tina and Elisabeth
[22:34:02] <bigfatgator> Tina answers a lot
[22:34:04] <@+^Nightbot> She is a twitch bitch, short enough to go in and watch Lilo and Stitch, bitch, short enough to get stuck in the fridge, bitch, short enough to never get a scar with more than a stitch, bitch, short enough to fall of the curb and call it a cliff, bitch, short enough to, you're just short, bitch

[22:34:53] <bigfatgator> Some of the products i install have norwegian connection on them, like the stoves
[22:35:02] <bigfatgator> Lots of stuffs are shipped from there anyways
[22:35:51] <%mrnordstrom> Don't know. I worked with em maybe 8 years ago so prob few of the ones I worked with are still there. I hope not, it's mentally rough stuff. :P
[22:37:03] <bigfatgator> It really is
[22:37:08] <bigfatgator> Im on my way out of it
[22:37:17] <bigfatgator> Cant handle customers any more, worked with customers my entire life
[22:37:29] <bigfatgator> Gonna work with animals or something lol
[22:38:08] <%mrnordstrom> Man I remember when I answered and it's this pissed off lady. And when it's a prob I can't really do shit about over the phone, she starts yelling that she has cancer and I'm making her cancer worse.
[22:38:19] <bigfatgator> People are fucking idiots, most of them.. and the ones who are nice you easily forgetg
[22:38:19] <%mrnordstrom> Yeah working with animals would be nice and calm
[22:38:30] <%mrnordstrom> Yeh
[22:38:34] <bigfatgator> You just remember the bad ones
[22:39:17] <%mrnordstrom> But I talked to that cancer lady for 30 mins and she actually apologized when I got her to calm down and talk to me. But those calls are awful.
[22:41:08] <bigfatgator> Yeah
[22:41:41] <%mrnordstrom> And you know, this is how it works, the people who take the most calls get the bonus money at the end of the month. So people did what we call "fob" calls. You tell the customer to restart the computer and call back if shit still doesn't work. Cuz then someone else gets the call. Insane. People try their best to get the customer to just hang up early instead of actually helping them.
[22:42:20] <%mrnordstrom> UK mentality heh
[22:42:24] <bigfatgator> I had to call a lady once that we couldnt make the delivery to her that day and that if she could be at home some other date of her choice, she said no this is the only time i will be at this house this month or something really crazy like that.. then i asked if she had neighbors who could like just open the door so i could get inside and then close after im done, or.. if she had parents; OFC her mom had JUST passed away so she got super pissed over that
[22:42:41] <bigfatgator> And the dad was terminally ill, also that she got really pissed over.. like i should have known
[22:43:26] <%mrnordstrom> Wow. Yeah people have a lot of problem and it's super easy for them to make those problems your problems. Especially over the phone. People wouldn't say it to your face.
[22:43:31] <%mrnordstrom> problems*
[22:44:34] <%mrnordstrom> And then we have the people who have 14 year old kids who "know computers". Super fucking annoying to talk to them. You have to talk to the kid instead. "Knows computers".
[22:44:57] <bigfatgator> And people always also say "Im not mad at you i know its not your fault" like when the store failed to inform me about additional things to deliver but they have a really bad ton against you anyway and are clearly pissed off
[22:45:06] <bigfatgator> Yeah,., it will just get worse and worse
[22:45:12] <bigfatgator> We will have super old population soon in this country
[22:45:21] <%mrnordstrom> Heh true
[22:45:22] <bigfatgator> That will need ton of care and attention, and help with EVERYTHING
[22:45:29] <%mrnordstrom> Well
[22:45:32] <%mrnordstrom> I won't stay here
[22:45:34] <%mrnordstrom> I can't
[22:45:38] <%mrnordstrom> Can't stand it
[22:45:48] <bigfatgator> I also put up TVs on walls and install them, those jobs at elder people take almost 2 hours
[22:45:51] <%mrnordstrom> It's suffocating
[22:45:55] <bigfatgator> Cos they wont let me out unless i explain how the TV works
[22:46:02] <%mrnordstrom> Hahhaha
[22:46:39] <%mrnordstrom> My stepmom can't turn on a fucking channel no matter how many times I show it because she's not interested in fucking learning how it works.

[22:46:55] <bigfatgator> You have to have iron mind lol
[22:47:12] <%mrnordstrom> You turn on the TV. Turn on the sound. Then use the fucking DreamBox remote control up and down to switch channels. Not hard.

[22:47:42] <bigfatgator> But nothing we can do about it really there will just be more and more of them
[22:48:00] <bigfatgator> And the costs will be insane, billions
[22:48:31] <%mrnordstrom> One of my best friends is the nurse who took care of me at the hospital. So kind. I've heard stories, people who pull out their CVK or PVK needles, blood everywhere, etc. And she deals with that shit, so well. Much respect.
[22:49:13] <bigfatgator> Yeah
[22:49:15] <%mrnordstrom> She's gonna start working at the ER soon. Imagine the stress.
[22:49:25] <bigfatgator> Cant wait for robots to take over some of that work in the future
[22:49:30] <%mrnordstrom> Hah indeed
[22:49:34] <bigfatgator> People are not ment to work with that lol to stressful
[22:49:44] <%mrnordstrom> :D
[22:50:00] <bigfatgator> Bacsk in the days people die when they are 60 but we will probably live until 100
[22:50:09] <bigfatgator> 40 years or more sicknesses and need of care e.t.c
[22:50:30] <%mrnordstrom> I apparently cannot fucking die no matter how hard I try, so I will live forever, I'm sure of it.
[22:50:36] <%mrnordstrom> To 150 at least.
[22:51:47] <bigfatgator> I hope i dont get that old, wouldn't wish it on anyone to clean up my shit, literately clean up my shit that is
[22:52:05] <%mrnordstrom> I mean, we'll need that care too I guess. I'm not looking forward to it. But things will prob be different 40 years from now.
[22:52:09] <bigfatgator> When i cant post memes i will probably call it quits

[07:35:43] <%mrnordstrom> But they only do d2 so what can you expect. Do cache or mirage and it's 90% chance a win.

[21:13:50] <yassir33> i bet scream will humiliate someone with an incredible one tap
[21:14:15] <Piggy_The_Sensei> u need snax, he, with his skill, outplays his opponents
[21:15:14] <Piggy_The_Sensei> they are talking about the game and im imagining it all happening on inferno NotLikeThis
[21:15:26] <Piggy_The_Sensei> y u do dis volvo NotLikeThis
[21:16:02] <Piggy_The_Sensei> is it me, or panzie looks like she use some drugs MingLee
[21:16:16] <yassir33> seems like she does Kappa

[21:17:08] <yassir33> my dream is to coach pro players or cast their games OSsloth
[21:17:12] <Piggy_The_Sensei> like coldzera
[21:17:29] <yassir33> cold uses drugs ?
[21:17:41] <Piggy_The_Sensei> maybe? MingLee
[21:17:55] <Piggy_The_Sensei> i just meant that coldzera uses awp passivly
[21:18:12] <yassir33> because he's the 2nd awp in SK

[21:18:40] <Piggy_The_Sensei> but... he could be the main one SoonerLater
[21:18:52] <Piggy_The_Sensei> but hes more deadly with a rifle
[21:19:01] <yassir33> lol i dont think so this gameplay's not made for him
[21:19:29] <yassir33> fallen's strength is his concentration
[21:19:42] <yassir33> he can remain on the same peek for 1 min 30
[21:19:52] <yassir33> cold has to move all the time
[21:20:08] <Piggy_The_Sensei> or stewie, he has to shake his mouse
[21:20:15] <Piggy_The_Sensei> stupid way but...
[21:20:33] <yassir33> he's deadly with a rifle and with an awp but with the awp he would be that kind of guy who could try KennyBs
[21:20:52] <yassir33> lel
[21:21:08] <Piggy_The_Sensei> like fallen prolly does like me, just watch around the crosshair, instead of moving or shaking the crosshair
[21:21:26] <Piggy_The_Sensei> there are a lot of ways SoonerLater
[21:22:12] <yassir33> the thing is that his allies allow him to keep the same position in safety althemoreso as he has nice reflex
[21:22:34] <yassir33> wtf was that laugh panzie cmonBruh
[21:24:21] <Piggy_The_Sensei> like you could do it DansGame
[21:24:55] <yassir33> well they're casters they dont imagine playing
[21:25:02] <yassir33> they just analyse games
[21:25:26] <Piggy_The_Sensei> like Sadokist MingLee appearantly hes MG3 MingLee
[21:25:36] <yassir33> well like me then XD
[21:25:47] <yassir33> but i think i can play better than him
[21:25:59] <yassir33> sometimes on casting he mistakes like a silver
[21:26:27] <Piggy_The_Sensei> im just hoping that all those years of playing 1.6 will pay off in csgo Kreygasm
[21:26:34] <yassir33> Ts' try a CPL and he says ok its just for lurking
[21:26:43] <yassir33> it will
[21:26:49] <yassir33> not at the begining but it will
[21:27:17] <Piggy_The_Sensei> like the game sense is there, i just need to adjust the aim, learn smokes
[21:27:28] <Piggy_The_Sensei> and re-learn timings SoonerLater
[21:27:32] <yassir33> lel yes

[21:40:41] <Piggy_The_Sensei> like its not worth for us to argue... we are just fanboys...
[21:41:23] <yassir33> yes but i analyse the game

[22:42:19] <yassir33> u're righy
[22:42:52] <%SupremeTerrific> I've studied a lot of languages in my free time, and none have been more difficult for me to pronounce than French, as strange as it sounds.
[22:43:28] <yassir33> its quite strange to pronounce u're right XD
[22:43:46] <%SupremeTerrific> Compared to English, at least. Very different. :P
[22:43:53] <yassir33> but when u understand some rules on grammar its eaaasy
[22:43:58] <%SupremeTerrific> Beautiful language. I just can't speak it for shit. lol
[22:44:16] <%SupremeTerrific> I'd be interested in learning to read and write it, but I doubt I'd ever speak it well.
[22:45:05] <yassir33> the only sound that changes from other languages is R
[22:45:15] <yassir33> thats why u think its hard
[22:45:46] <yassir33> but speaking it well is a bit easy the most difficult is speaking fast
[22:46:24] <%SupremeTerrific> I'll probably try the language again within the next few years, whenever I have the time. I just remember it being overwhelming at 18, when I had other language studies in the same semester. lol

[21:42:33] <%mrnordstrom> Poor post-plant work, people push without really trading, let long A push kill several people
[21:42:48] <%mrnordstrom> But hey NiP always slow start
[21:43:21] <yassir33> this map's interesting for strategy u know
[21:43:50] <yassir33> if u mean to get a good strategy on this map u have to be very smart
[21:44:13] PART: yassir33
[21:44:19] <yassir33> CTs need to spread all over the map knowing they have to let 3 ppl on B
[21:44:48] <yassir33> the 2 guys on A have to let Ts a little window to push so that they can call a rotate from their team
[21:45:06] <yassir33> CT side on this map is all about rotate
[21:45:13] JOIN: Emtecyyy, yassir33
[21:46:51] <yassir33> but with the stairs u could easily let 4 CTs on B like 1 stairs 1 house or behind site 1 dropper and 1 on the window able to rotate
[21:47:35] <yassir33> that would block Ts B rush but they cant let only 1 ct watch the whole A area alone

[21:51:20] <yassir33> WTF why are they going for a CPL ?!
[21:51:45] JOIN: Piukam
[21:52:43] <%mrnordstrom> Sometimes they do a full B smoke strat to set up for a later round when they throw the exact same smokes to get CT to rotate from A, then push A instead.
[21:54:07] <yassir33> yeah but when they go for a CPL B from this position like they throw smokes from mid they force CTs to back up on B which gives them a free A site... they should use that CPL as a decoy to take A
[21:56:14] <%mrnordstrom> Like I said, it's what they do, that's why the smokes are thrown from mid and not long B. They execute B now and later they may decide to do the same thing and push A instead, the CTs see the same smokes and may rotate from A because it was a B hit last time.
[21:56:40] <yassir33> send a lurker in the CPL for a trade will give them time for this A rotate and plant
[21:56:48] <yassir33> yea u're right
[21:56:55] <%mrnordstrom> Yea true
[21:57:36] <~%+DrWallin> GO NIP

[22:19:11] <%SupremeTerrific> Uggghhhh, I had such a good clutch play the other day. 1v1 on d2 and got behind the T in tunnels...And whiffed my first MP9 burst and almost died. Clutched it, but I wanted to kill myself in that split second. x)
[22:19:55] <yassir33> well when i analyse the difference is that i imagine diferent situations like if u plant a bomb i first imagine u're waiting next to it then i say he must be away knowing that the bomb is planted here then i ask myself what infos does he have etc
[22:20:30] <yassir33> well i made a nice 1 v 5 clutch a few weeks ago on inferno just on the mid

[22:20:47] <%SupremeTerrific> Yep, have to be careful with the unpredictable ones. :P
[22:21:06] <yassir33> i remained in the mid and i peaked angle by angle pickin up the kills until i get the ace
[22:21:46] <yassir33> well i ask this as well like what if he was just trying to brain me like he plants here and goes there instead of there

[22:51:10] <%Emtecyyy> being sick in summer is awful , i hate it
[22:51:13] <%SupremeTerrific> As for the whole work ethic thing, I'm pretty sure that's what happened with Fnatic, and why they split. Flusha's even said as much, feeling like they weren't focused in pracs. And it's hit and miss in NA. C9 seems like they have a lot of motivation right now, and it's showing. I almost feel like Liquid so rarely keeps a stable roster long enough to form a team bond.

[00:13:48] <bigfatgator> Yes i was in the army in 2009
[00:14:12] <bigfatgator> Good times
[00:14:12] <yassir33> well sry if u feel insulted but i hate army and police
[00:14:26] <bigfatgator> Why
[00:14:28] <yassir33> cant get on well with them XD
[00:14:40] <yassir33> last time police saw me they took me to their stuff
[00:14:46] <yassir33> like control me etc
[00:14:50] <yassir33> and i didnt do shit
[00:14:53] <bigfatgator> Probably for a reason
[00:15:01] <yassir33> they had mistaken
[00:15:20] <bigfatgator> So they just misstook you for someone ells once and now you disslike them? It was a misstake then :P
[00:15:27] <bigfatgator> Very rare
[00:15:31] <yassir33> well not only once
[00:15:34] <bigfatgator> Like winning the lottery
[00:15:37] <bigfatgator> Or maybe even less rare
[00:15:40] <yassir33> my first problem with them was at 11 yo
[00:15:54] <bigfatgator> If it happens over and over again then you are probably the problem :P
[00:16:05] <yassir33> some ppl from my class said i insulted them and i beat theù
[00:16:25] <yassir33> they picked me out of school and bringed me to building to ask me
[00:16:57] <yassir33> u're maybe right i dont know what being good means probably
[00:17:09] <yassir33> but the main reason is racism
[00:17:18] <bigfatgator> Being good means not doing illegal things and keeping to yourself
[00:17:20] <bigfatgator> I guess
[00:17:29] <yassir33> well i dont smoke drugs
[00:17:44] <yassir33> when i'm at party im the only one who doesnt drink
[00:17:56] <bigfatgator> Shouldn't even surround yourself with those type of people either
[00:18:25] <yassir33> well idk how is the police in sweden but in france they're horrible with strangers
[00:18:29] <bigfatgator> When you hang out with people ask yourself would these be people that i would let my kids hang out with
[00:18:36] <bigfatgator> And if answer is no, then say thank you and leave
[00:19:02] <yassir33> i dont hang out with this kind of people
[00:19:21] <~%+DrWallin> gator
[00:19:26] <yassir33> the fact is that when u come from morocco for police u're dead

[00:20:04] <yassir33> and u nina ? do u act all proper ? Kappa

[00:20:39] <yassir33> gator i could tell and show u things that could probably scare u ...
[00:20:39] <bigfatgator> I have a friend whos a cop, he works in a very shitty area in suburbs of Stockholm.. its not good right for police in Sweden

[00:22:33] <yassir33> and then in my neighborhood some ppl are scared

[00:22:54] <bigfatgator> Spend time with family and close friends
[00:22:56] <%mrnordstrom> Wtf kind of advice is that
[00:23:09] <yassir33> like i'm gonna kill u and ur whole family get out of this country terrorists
[00:23:10] <bigfatgator> People are generally shit
[00:23:15] <bigfatgator> Not all of them
[00:23:19] <bigfatgator> Ofc not
[00:23:19] <~%+DrWallin> i'd say that advice is pretty solid
[00:23:41] <bigfatgator> But, not much good is gonna come from being very "utåtriktad"
[00:23:42] <bigfatgator> utåt
[00:24:02] <~%+DrWallin> i think that advice sounded worse than it is
[00:24:03] <bigfatgator> Showing off your personality to much, showing off your religion, your beliefs
[00:24:16] <yassir33> gator when u get out of home at 6 : 50 AM to go to school and u discover that someone tagged on ur door that he was going to catch u and cut ur head i dont think u can be solid
[00:24:32] <%mrnordstrom> "Keep to yourself" sounds like "don't get any friends, stay inside, hide, because people are dangerous"
[00:24:39] <~%+DrWallin> SOUNDS LIKE
[00:24:43] <~%+DrWallin> ´S O U N D S L I K E
[00:24:50] <bigfatgator> I emediatley said after
[00:24:51] <yassir33> sounds but maybe isnt ?
[00:25:04] <~%+DrWallin> maybe people should learn to take the words they hear rather than change them and turn them into their own meaning.
[00:25:05] <%mrnordstrom> He literally just said to not show off your personality
[00:25:07] <bigfatgator> "Keep with close friends and family"
[00:25:28] <yassir33> i already know it
[00:25:32] <bigfatgator> Yeah i dont think its very good to go in twitter and say "I HATE MEN I THINK THEY ARE DISTGUSTING"
[00:25:33] <~%+DrWallin> Yeah, "too much" as he added
[00:25:36] <bigfatgator> its fine to think and feel that way
[00:25:42] <bigfatgator> But no need to show that off to everyone
[00:25:54] <bigfatgator> No need to tell the whole world what you think cos the world doesnt care
[00:26:11] <~%+DrWallin> and almost anything you say can get you in trouble lmao
[00:26:14] <~%+DrWallin> cuz people are fucking idiots.
[00:26:26] <bigfatgator> Ye, just be strong in yourself instead
[00:26:30] <~%+DrWallin> so just do you /shrug
[00:26:31] <bigfatgator> Like if you are muslim, be a muslim
[00:26:38] <%mrnordstrom> Some people are extrovert and feel good that way
[00:26:40] <bigfatgator> But you dont have to go to school dressed like a muslim
[00:26:43] <yassir33> the difference between ur example and here is that if i couldnt hate police that much i would probably become mad
[00:26:45] <bigfatgator> You could be muslim at home, or with family
[00:26:54] <yassir33> like some people i know did
[00:26:56] <~%+DrWallin> yeah and that's fine and im sure they find ways to deal with the consequences of that
[00:27:19] <bigfatgator> Sure but if you are extrovert then you also probably learnt how to deal with people being mean to you
[00:27:28] <bigfatgator> Being extrovert combined with being a bit soft is not a great combo
[00:27:38] <yassir33> gator i go to school dressed with jean nike air max and a normal T shirt or smth like this
[00:27:45] <bigfatgator> Yeah thats good
[00:27:54] <bigfatgator> Generalyl in school i would say dont stick out to much
[00:28:00] <bigfatgator> Its a lot easier to do that when you are 25

[00:28:30] <~%+DrWallin> you've literally taken gators words and turned it into something else

[00:30:13] <bigfatgator> Det är okej
[00:30:20] <~%+DrWallin> När jag haft mina perioder utan umgänge och väldigt instängd så har jag oftast inte känt att jag gömmer mig eller något, jag har ba haft det jävligt nice, pratat med dom jag verkligen bryr mig om och mår bra med, chillat och känt lugnet, ba mått fint
[00:30:30] <yassir33> gator ur advice was good but its comon and its not enough
[00:30:36] <%mrnordstrom> Och nu ar det val inte nodvandigtvis dig vi pratar om
[00:30:38] <~%+DrWallin> det måste inte vara så fruktansvärt dåligt att inte vara mitt uppi folkmassor och göra sig hörd hela tiden.
[00:30:50] <%mrnordstrom> Ni snackar generellt
[00:30:57] <~%+DrWallin> och jag gav exempel

[00:31:03] <~%+DrWallin> på att man kan ta det som något kefft eller bra.
[00:31:14] <yassir33> well need something else gator
[00:31:31] <bigfatgator> There is a place and time for everything and perhaps its not right now :P
[00:31:45] <yassir33> don't u understand that just being in one of the only muslim families of my neighborhood can kill me ?
[00:31:53] <~%+DrWallin> se det som något kefft eller bra
[00:32:15] <yassir33> i'm truely not joking dude that's not cuz i'm behind my computer i tell u truth man
[00:32:20] <bigfatgator> I dont think you should hide religion
[00:32:36] <%mrnordstrom> Lat folk vara som de vill
[00:33:06] <yassir33> i dont even show it i keep it to myself i raise on my own but when people attempt to ur life for reasons that u dont understand u have to be prepared
[00:33:11] <bigfatgator> Also yassir, dont walk around and think about other people like they always wanna get to you or they always wanna harm you
[00:33:18] <bigfatgator> sad truth is, most people dont really care at all
[00:33:49] <bigfatgator> you might think cops are after you cos they harass you, but in general, let me tell you that they dont really care.. its not personal for them but its personal for you thats the issue
[00:34:02] <yassir33> i dont think all people want to but when i find tags on my door i know that 1 person is around lookin for me or another member of my family to kill him
[00:34:02] <~%+DrWallin> det är skillnad på råd och order.
[00:34:07] <~%+DrWallin> "låt folk vara som dom vill"

[00:34:54] <bigfatgator> yassir those are serious threats, ofc thats not acceptable, you should call the cops.. but also realise that there is a very long way between posting something on someone door and actually doing it
[00:35:51] <~%+DrWallin> yassir why don't your family consider moving someplace else?
[00:35:51] <yassir33> well yes there's a long way but how far did this guy crossed this way ?

[00:36:16] <%mrnordstrom> Just saying, folk ar olika.
[00:36:17] <~%+DrWallin> I've kinda always moved to another city once i've felt too uncomfortable staying
[00:36:17] <yassir33> cuz we dont have that much money nina i live with my mom and my sister
[00:36:21] <~%+DrWallin> works i guess
[00:36:26] <bigfatgator> Fast man kan ju välja vilket crew man ska hänga med också nordström :)
[00:36:32] <%mrnordstrom> Ja?
[00:36:35] <bigfatgator> jag sa ju faktiskt direkt efteråt, "close friends or family"
[00:36:45] <yassir33> and my brother needs my mom to help him taking care of his daughter
[00:37:18] <bigfatgator> But you are still in school right?
[00:37:19] <yassir33> the first thing i said when i saw these tags first was "ok if u're looking for me then catch me"
[00:37:28] <yassir33> yes in the university
[00:37:30] <~%+DrWallin> asså nordström
[00:37:43] <bigfatgator> Nina släpp de nu :P
[00:38:09] <~%+DrWallin> Du kanske ska försöka läsa allt innan du kommenterar på det, gator har inte sagt att man ska gömma sig, har inte sagt att man ska vara ensam, ingenting sånt
[00:38:25] <bigfatgator> Hördö
[00:38:27] <~%+DrWallin> det han har pratat om är väl mer överlag moderation
[00:38:31] <~%+DrWallin> ja ja
[00:38:53] <~%+DrWallin> yassir you probably shouldn't trigger people if they are threatening you
[00:38:59] <~%+DrWallin> just stay away from that tbh fam.
[00:39:04] <bigfatgator> Its hard yasir, i have never been in that situation, ofc family is always #1.. so you are doing the right thing with staying
[00:39:05] <~%+DrWallin> smh
[00:39:30] <yassir33> i was in the street going to school at 6:50 and i litterally screamed it cuz i became mad at this moment

[00:39:46] <~%+DrWallin> well that's stupid
[00:39:49] <~%+DrWallin> try not to be stupid
[00:40:00] <yassir33> yes i do i tryed to find out who did
[00:40:06] <bigfatgator> Jag menade en mental bubbla, men det var ju typ otydligt av mig antar jag
[00:40:08] <yassir33> i thought that i found 1 of these guys
[00:40:19] <yassir33> with some friends we caught him
[00:40:35] <bigfatgator> När jag säger att jag går in en min egna bubbla, dfå menar jag ju min hjärna bara.. och inte att jag isolerar hela min kropp
[00:40:36] <yassir33> i asked him and i saw he was scared cuz i wasnt alone
[00:40:42] <bigfatgator> Jag kan ju gå in i min bubbla på jobbet liksom
[00:40:48] <~%+DrWallin> ´den bubblan kan ju vara en bubbla med dina nära och kära, trygghet, glädje, lugn, måste ju inte vara en bubbla med ensamhet och depp

[00:43:32] <yassir33> the main thing is that when we call police for that they take pictures for evidence and they go cuz they cant do anything about that
[00:44:06] <bigfatgator> Its a sad reality
[00:44:16] <yassir33> yes
[00:44:19] <bigfatgator> But they do it cos they know that in 99/100 cases, nothing well happen

[00:45:36] <yassir33> 3 years ago my neighbor was found dead
[00:45:40] <yassir33> he commited suicide
[00:45:49] <bigfatgator> Yes thats a perfectly good sign to just move
[00:46:01] <yassir33> they came and said that they would come often to care about people
[00:46:16] <yassir33> but since they said this nothing
[00:46:35] <bigfatgator> Best you could do is move, if you not your whole family
[00:46:43] <yassir33> can u imagine this ? i was 15 and i litterally found my neighbor dead
[00:46:52] <bigfatgator> Then you, you need to move.. quit school and go find work somewhere, maybe outside of France, then move your family there with you
[00:47:03] <bigfatgator> if its that bad
[00:47:25] <yassir33> im one of the strongest ones in my family i wont flee cuz then my niece could be threatened
[00:47:42] <yassir33> i'll move from france after university
[00:48:12] <bigfatgator> Sounds like a good plan
[00:48:18] <bigfatgator> Plenty of good places to live in this world
[00:48:29] <bigfatgator> Everyone is up to pretty good standards, i have lived in a few countries myself
[00:48:32] <yassir33> yea i think about using the languages i speak to find a good country
[00:48:38] <bigfatgator> No big difference really, polen, slovenia
[00:48:47] <bigfatgator> you think its shit countries but they are better then most people think
[00:49:03] <bigfatgator> Standard overall is pretty high, so dont just think about moving around in France, think about a brand new country
[00:49:22] <bigfatgator> Just look at gaming and people who play computer games
[00:49:25] <yassir33> that's why i give u this advice guys trust me do not come in france for holidays
[00:49:28] <bigfatgator> We play with people from Polen, Italy
[00:49:42] <bigfatgator> Everyone has internet connection, PC.. i mean.. world standard is pretty high for most
[00:49:53] <yassir33> i know this
[00:50:29] <yassir33> i'll have to make a choice between england italy spain morocco and sweden
[00:50:36] <yassir33> after studies
[00:51:12] <bigfatgator> Yeah thats plenty of options, look for countries with good healthcare and just relocate your fam
[00:51:29] <yassir33> my family doesnt want to
[00:51:31] <yassir33> they h
[00:51:36] <yassir33> wanna stay here
[00:52:37] <yassir33> staying in these conditions is not courage btw its called having no money or bullshit
[00:54:35] <bigfatgator> I mean if they dont have money then its not like its gonna get worse if they move they will just have no money but in a country where they dont get threated and shit
[00:55:15] <yassir33> if they move from france they'll have money
[00:55:23] <bigfatgator> Its good that you care about your family so much tho i hope that keeps you out of trouble that has saved me many times, when ever you feel like doing something stupid just think about how you would disappoint your family.
[00:55:26] <yassir33> my mother has diplomas
[00:56:01] <yassir33> they didnt give her the same job when she came in france
[00:56:20] <yassir33> she had a good salary
[00:56:25] <yassir33> but in france no
[00:56:40] <bigfatgator> Maybe you can find a country that will say yes then
[00:56:45] <bigfatgator> Gotta be some country that says yes
[00:57:06] <yassir33> do u guys see what happens here ? like i saw some newspapers from northern countries

[01:34:32] <yassir33> well show me that shroud is not over rated
[01:34:49] <%SupremeTerrific> http://www.hltv.org/?pageid=173&statsfilter=2048&playerid=8349
[01:34:51] <yassir33> last LAN he played against good EU teams he got destroyed
[01:35:05] <%SupremeTerrific> People keep going on this narrative that Shroud is bad on LAN, but his numbers say otherwise.
[01:35:37] <%SupremeTerrific> He's had some bad LAN performances that have stuck in people's memory, but if he were truly underperforming, C9 would have kicked him, like they did with Freakazoid.
[01:35:42] <yassir33> and people say hiko is not better than him
[01:35:48] <yassir33> but when i see them playing
[01:35:57] <yassir33> hiko is definitely better
[01:36:12] <yassir33> well i remember about last ones
[01:36:37] <yassir33> and in this lan some errors are made that allow him to get some frags
[01:36:56] <yassir33> i think they're tired cuz the usually dont do these errors
[01:38:03] <OfficialScrap> like when KennyS didnt get any kills :)
[01:38:08] <%SupremeTerrific> lol
[01:38:09] <yassir33> yea
[01:38:17] <yassir33> but after holidays he woke up
[01:38:32] <yassir33> i saw his last game against danmark
[01:38:55] <yassir33> he was top fraggin on nuke and that was much better than his 0 kill
[01:39:43] <%SupremeTerrific> Personally, I don't care about Hiko or Liquid. I watch Hiko because he's fun to watch in pugs, but I don't really like his attitude as a team leader. The Liquid lineup changes too much to build a strong team identity.
[01:40:03] <yassir33> yea thats normal
[01:40:13] <yassir33> for me hiko is not IGL
[01:40:20] <yassir33> hiko has to entry
[01:40:37] <%SupremeTerrific> Well, he's not the IGL. Peacemaker is their coach.
[01:40:48] <yassir33> he's an eco warrior and a nice rifler
[01:41:04] JOIN: Springarn
[01:41:21] <yassir33> ye but i mean that best entry fraggers for example dont care about knowing 1000 strats
[01:41:35] <yassir33> they are more focused on their aim
[01:41:38] <%SupremeTerrific> But Hiko wanted more control in roster decisions than he had on C9, because he wanted to kick people all of the time for having a bad event, or bad month, and that's not how you build a team.
[01:41:46] <%mrnordstrom> I'm on the same DM server as Bååten apparently. His K/D is 3.
[01:41:54] <%mrnordstrom> From fnatic academy

[01:44:19] <yassir33> this is disapointing like im just MGE and i wouldve done that just to give my entry fragger the kill

[01:47:24] <yassir33> they are just thinking about taking a single round
[01:47:26] <%SupremeTerrific> You have to assume that on CS of this level, they're not just forgetting their utility, but have a plan somewhere else for it. It isn't always true, ofc, but it usually is.
[01:47:37] <yassir33> they dont care about losing 3 rounds for it

[21:20:49] <yassir33> even if on BO1 they had some doubts about my sniper plays
[21:21:05] <yassir33> yea some of them play dota cod etc
[21:21:11] <%Jbeaumont97> Things that'll get you purged/timed are the following; porn, politics, religious stuff, illegal stuff, racism, excessive rudeness or bullying, promotions/advertising.
[21:21:32] <~%+DrWallin> lets just put cheating into illegal stuff
[21:21:34] <yassir33> one of my friends got vac from dota cuz he used a 100% crit script
[21:21:45] <@%jnthnxxx> she didnt mention cheating but its a unwritten rule

[21:22:58] <yassir33> think i might clean up that friend list lel
[21:23:01] <~%+DrWallin> JESUS CHRIST
[21:23:07] <~%+DrWallin> Yeah yassir you should
[21:23:09] <%SupremeTerrific> Wait, politics is banned, but shit about feminism isn't? lol
[21:23:14] <yassir33> but u guys have to know that cheating in france is normal
[21:23:16] <@%jnthnxxx> playin with the hair between teeth its funny
[21:23:17] <~%+DrWallin> it doesn't look good when people check you and there's so much cheat stuff around
[21:23:37] <yassir33> well some of these accounts belong to the same person
[21:23:37] <@%jnthnxxx> its bad. literally
[21:23:39] <~%+DrWallin> yassir cheating everywhere is normal it's got nothing to do with france
[21:23:47] <~%+DrWallin> and it's normal because half of the population
[21:23:51] <~%+DrWallin> are less smart than average
[21:23:57] <~%+DrWallin> aka
[21:23:58] <Ihavealongbanana> ns
[21:24:00] <~%+DrWallin> dumb fucks
[21:24:01] <yassir33> but in france they really like it cuz when they rage they activate :/
[21:24:10] <~%+DrWallin> people do that everywhere
[21:24:16] <~%+DrWallin> you just gotta pick another crowd of friends
[21:24:26] <Ihavealongbanana> on cod alot these days
[21:24:28] <%Jbeaumont97> If people can't deal with losing then they shouldn't play a competitive game
[21:24:31] <yassir33> cant really ignore some of them
[21:24:39] <@%jnthnxxx> why
[21:24:52] <yassir33> at least 20 of them were in my BO1 team and we were french champions on PC
[21:24:52] <Ihavealongbanana> wallers
[21:25:03] <%SupremeTerrific> Because of cheats. LUL
[21:25:07] <~%+DrWallin> I've been playing a lot of non-prime MM lately and there's so much cheaters that boost people for money
[21:25:09] <yassir33> 5 roasters for the team from rifles to snipers
[21:25:16] <@%jnthnxxx> im a bit extremist but to me, cheater = untrustworthy person person
[21:25:17] <~%+DrWallin> so i don't think it's about playing the game for them
[21:25:19] <@%jnthnxxx> ArsonNoSexy
[21:25:19] <~%+DrWallin> it's just money
[21:25:19] <%Jbeaumont97> Ewww, non prime
[21:25:22] <%SupremeTerrific> You'd be surprised how easy it is to ignore someone. Just have a bad breakup and you'll learn how. Kappa
[21:25:37] <yassir33> well i found a cheater yesterday on prime MM
[21:25:42] <~%+DrWallin> ya beaumont

[21:26:21] <yassir33> so i put it here u guys can see it lel
[21:26:23] <%Jbeaumont97> Personally I don't think prime matchmaking has made things better for people who play in it, but it's sure as hell made things a lot worse for people who don't play prime
[21:26:33] <~%+DrWallin> yeah that's truy
[21:26:34] <~%+DrWallin> tru
[21:26:34] <%SupremeTerrific> No, srs, politics is against the rules. Does that include constant jokes about feminism and women? Has been happening often lately.
[21:26:37] <Ihavealongbanana> well prime is shet

[21:27:14] <yassir33> well u guys just have to look at the deleted message to see profile
[21:27:14] <@%jnthnxxx> people dont talk at all
[21:27:19] <@%jnthnxxx> BibleThump
[21:27:39] <Ihavealongbanana> i would win if i would have feeling anymorw
[21:27:46] <yassir33> i think the worst thing on CS is having a bad team
[21:27:50] <%Jbeaumont97> Things that'll get you purged/timed are the following; porn, politics, religious stuff, illegal stuff, racism, excessive rudeness or bullying, promotions/advertising.
[21:27:53] <Ihavealongbanana> but i lost feeling
[21:28:04] <%Jbeaumont97> BibleThump drwH I Lube You All drwH BibleThump
[21:28:05] <%SupremeTerrific> Yeah, I know the rule. I'm asking for clarification on the rule.
[21:28:13] <Ihavealongbanana> i retired for a while from csgo
[21:28:13] <@%jnthnxxx> a bad team its a lose the 90% of the times
[21:28:20] <%SupremeTerrific> Because it's too often I see mods posting stuff about "feminism" in the chat.
[21:28:23] <%Jbeaumont97> Forgot I'd copied the rules drwDerp
[21:28:29] <yassir33> well we talked about porn 2 days ago and niner didnt really feel triggered or smth
[21:28:43] <Ihavealongbanana> rare ocasion
[21:28:43] <yassir33> but it was scrap's fault Kappa
[21:28:49] <@%jnthnxxx> she said u were talkin about stuff she dont want to read
[21:28:50] <@%jnthnxxx> so
[21:28:57] <@%jnthnxxx> kinda dont want u to talk about it
[21:29:03] <yassir33> oh ye forgot XD
[21:29:16] <Ihavealongbanana> well i still have in head about 40s stuff
[21:29:24] <%SupremeTerrific> Actually, with the rules fresh in mind, you nerds break them all the damn time, mods included. Might as well delete the rules, since they don't apply at all. LUL
[21:29:37] <@%jnthnxxx> not me PRChase

[21:29:54] <@%jnthnxxx> NO WAY
[21:29:57] <@%jnthnxxx> LIES
[21:29:58] <%Jbeaumont97> Way I see MM is that like 30% of the time you're going to win no matter what because of your team being good, 30% of the time you're going to lose no matter what you're going to lose because your team is bad, the other 40% is down to how well you play :) simplistic model but it keeps me sane while playing
[21:29:58] <@%jnthnxxx> STOP
[21:30:02] <yassir33> he says this allllll the time
[21:30:07] <%SupremeTerrific> You're not as bad as Simon. lol

[21:36:54] <%SupremeTerrific> You gotta be pretty fuckin' shit at MW2 to hack your way into the pro scene. The pro scene for that game had a pretty low barrier to entry.
[21:36:58] <Ihavealongbanana> why would you cheat in bo1

[23:13:31] <~%+DrWallin> does that really work?

[23:18:05] <@%jnthnxxx> idk, no idea

[23:20:41] <@%jnthnxxx> DrWallin everytime u report someone, multiple times in the same match, the report code is it different?
[23:21:02] <~%+DrWallin> no it doesn't count anyway
[23:21:09] <@%jnthnxxx> oh
[23:21:15] <~%+DrWallin> that wouldn't work, they would send everyone to overwatch if that worked
[23:21:31] <~%+DrWallin> and overwatch is already overflowing with cases that arent even cheats just because the enemy teams are salty and report anyway
[23:22:05] <~%+DrWallin> they tried to bring the amount of reports needed for OW down to 5 i think, but they had to increase it to 11 because it was just too easy to send people to OW
[23:23:08] <@%jnthnxxx> ive never read about it tbh, im curious now

[02:04:31] <~%+DrWallin> i think

[02:05:20] <yassir33> not what i'm asking
[02:05:33] <yassir33> but for example in my mind when i'm clutching or smth

[02:06:37] <~%+DrWallin> if course you're constantly thinking
[02:06:48] <yassir33> yes but in my mind its intense
[02:06:58] <%mrnordstrom> I don't get the question
[02:07:03] <yassir33> and it's a bit anoying like i have 3 questions for 1 person
[02:07:15] <yassir33> and he just comes the easiest way for the dual
[02:07:17] <~%+DrWallin> anticipating their movement, remembering patterns those specific players have done before if they're sneaky or rushy or whatever, keeping your back clear, trying to take them out one at a time
[02:07:35] <~%+DrWallin> he's just asking if you're analyzing
[02:07:47] <yassir33> i'm more like thinking about
[02:08:18] <~%+DrWallin> idk
[02:08:21] <yassir33> weapons then i have the stuff remaining i keep in mind the stuff infos i have then i watch the back
[02:08:28] <~%+DrWallin> when im in the zone im pretty good at anticipating
[02:08:46] <yassir33> then i ask about jukes
[02:09:02] <yassir33> and it doesnt stop until someone dies
[02:09:27] <yassir33> well of course u're good at it
[02:09:39] <~%+DrWallin> maybe it's ez but, the first guy here was standing behind the pillar im looking at first, and i just figured he'd move back to forest cuz he only knew we had a guy on short and they had a guy in kitchen already

[02:13:59] <yassir33> and with 50 fps i have to play more stuff than anything
[02:14:09] <@%jnthnxxx> if u question to yourself too much u end doubting sometimes

[02:15:23] <@%jnthnxxx> or time
[02:15:26] <@%jnthnxxx> whatever
[02:15:38] <yassir33> sometimes when i'm very efficient i one tap 1 or 2 ennemies in like 5 seconds
[02:15:57] <yassir33> but these are my best plays XD
[02:16:06] <yassir33> january
[02:16:09] <yassir33> for CS GO
[02:16:24] <yassir33> i used to play CSS for like 2 or 3 years until 2011
[02:16:31] <yassir33> 2013*
[02:16:41] <yassir33> then i had a break until january
[02:16:56] <@%jnthnxxx> okay, to me u have to first focus in your gameplay, u can love strats and study whatever u want but if u dont have an smooth gameplay u r not goin to be efficient in your strats
[02:17:02] <@%jnthnxxx> well thats wat i think
[02:17:16] <yassir33> i found a nice role
[02:17:21] <yassir33> i'm a support for entries
[02:17:43] <yassir33> i know some popflashes for certain spots that allow my mates to get the kills
[02:18:11] PART: killertommas
[02:18:22] <yassir33> but the thing is that in my rank they don't do what i say like when i say i molly u can go now i have to go myself to pick out every single ennemy in the area
[02:18:22] <@%jnthnxxx> u think too much for now, i have that feel
[02:18:33] <yassir33> i feel that too lel
[02:18:38] <@%jnthnxxx> and u always try to make u look spectacualr in what u do

[02:22:40] <@%jnthnxxx> its the feel i have when i read what u say

[02:25:08] <%mrnordstrom> Especially at MGE

[02:25:58] <yassir33> to make sure that my aim default or my fps default wont be anoying in my gameplay
[02:26:31] <yassir33> for me its the complete contrary idk how u feel it

[02:27:13] <OfficialScrap> a softy i like it SeemsGood
[02:27:15] <@%jnthnxxx> works if u have an entire team doin it well and if the other team doesnt have strats to counter it
[02:27:36] <@%jnthnxxx> and sometimes a guy trustin his guts and doin himself can fuk ur strat easily
[02:27:41] <yassir33> my strats aren't made for a whole team i make it for 2 or 3 players
[02:27:52] <@%jnthnxxx> even worse
[02:27:55] <@%jnthnxxx> to me.
[02:28:13] <yassir33> didnt see for the moment like if they kill the strat we change
[02:28:21] <yassir33> before getting killed as u said
[02:28:30] <yassir33> always have a B option
[02:28:37] <@%jnthnxxx> havin a strat for the whole team and a team that can be polivalent its the best, but sometimes guts > strategies
[02:29:00] <@%jnthnxxx> i dont know everyone its different so i gues we just think... different
[02:29:26] <yassir33> i work with strats just cuz i cant be sure about my accuracy and i know i cant win every 1 v 1 cuz of this or my FPS
[02:29:57] <@%jnthnxxx> u r good with strats, keep that, then now focus in your individual performance
[02:30:16] <yassir33> i nearly reached the maximum of my solo perfs
[02:30:30] <yassir33> like my FPS dont allow me everythinh
[02:30:46] <yassir33> i played a 1 v 1 against a guy i used to play with
[02:30:49] <@%jnthnxxx> never think about u reach ur peak

I'm back to 800x600 and it feels so much more responsive for some reason, not sure why, just feels right. I like 1024 as well, gives enough detail, but it feels a liiiitle bit "slower" to me than 1024, it's really hard to describe.

[21:20:23] <bigfatgator> And i dont like to half ass it
[21:20:46] <bigfatgator> Sucks to play when you know you have been a lot better then what you are right now :P
[21:22:03] <bigfatgator> Probably same thing thats happening to Olofmesiter right now

[21:27:32] <yassir33> but he may have to work harder to get back to his old level
[21:27:56] <bigfatgator> Sadly i dont think he ever will
[21:28:14] <yassir33> and ya its not encouraging to play when u know u've once been better than what u're now
[21:28:27] <yassir33> i hope for him he will get this skill back
[21:28:28] <bigfatgator> Its very rare for players to be super good and then be really bad and then be godlike again.
[21:28:37] <bigfatgator> I cant think of anyone whos pulled that off
[21:28:45] <yassir33> i'm sorry but im fed up with this skill losing from a lot of pros
[21:29:06] <yassir33> well look at kennys for this he's a nice example
[21:29:26] <yassir33> he was the best awp for 3 years and then he lost a bit of his level
[21:30:23] <yassir33> and now he came back stronger than he was ... the only thing is that he lost half of his skill cuz of the new meta sniper
[21:30:58] <yassir33> awpers cant peak like they used to do and thats anoying cuz they're blocked
[21:31:07] <bigfatgator> You really think KennyS is as good as he was before?
[21:31:48] <yassir33> maybe not as good as but he took back some reflexes he lost
[21:32:20] <yassir33> the KennyB for example is back now and it succeeds nearly all the time

[22:33:13] <%SupremeTerrific> My dad used to get fucked over all of the time, back when he drove trucks and had no union. Then, he switched to driving buses, and we have a state union for that. They made sure that he always got his pay increases when he'd earned them, despite bosses trying to short him all the time, and the few times he was taken to court for accidents, they provided him with a lawyer. Can definitely appreciate that.

[12:19:15] <bigfatgator> We can never tell
[12:19:19] <@%jnthnxxx> tru, but more in general, hes doin fine but all the team is doing better
[12:19:24] <bigfatgator> NiP are playing different cos they dont havve a coach
[12:19:28] <bigfatgator> They are more free roaming
[12:19:34] <bigfatgator> They usually look better while doing this
[12:19:47] <bigfatgator> But against really good teams they get punished
[12:19:52] <%Jbeaumont97> I don't know, they improved a lot since bringing in Threat
[12:19:59] <bigfatgator> Threat is not with them in Kiev
[12:20:18] <%Jbeaumont97> I know, but NiP after Threat > NiP before Threat
[12:20:33] <@%jnthnxxx> threat still being the coach ha, but his watching demos in a hideout LUL
[12:20:44] <bigfatgator> Yup
[12:20:47] <bigfatgator> But he was also IGL
[12:20:58] <bigfatgator> And now Xizt is IGL again, so split second ingame decisions are back on Xizt again
[12:21:28] <@%jnthnxxx> ye, tbh i trust more the guts of the player that is playing the match to know what to do

[12:22:18] <%Jbeaumont97> NiP would be better if they had Pronax instead, but that's unlikely to happen
[12:22:39] <bigfatgator> Threat is perfect as IGL

[13:37:01] <%Jbeaumont97> I could see Maikelele replacing Friberg or Xizt but even that's unlikely, and there's no way they'd announce that on stage like that
[13:37:30] <bigfatgator> He sucks with rifles and f0rest is already a better AWP then Maikel

[22:47:47] <@%jnthnxxx> y means and
[22:47:48] <@%leanderb> jnthnxxx yeah ur right they do, but in spain its silver LUL its just cos silver was the currency when the language was introduced to latin america LUL
[22:47:48] <%mrnordstrom> No...
[22:47:50] <@%jnthnxxx> o means or
[22:47:53] <@%jnthnxxx> so plata o plomo

[22:51:50] <yassir33> like if u talk about europeans its easy
[22:52:04] <yassir33> latinos are harder to understand with language
[22:52:37] <%mrnordstrom> I like spanish, nice language
[22:52:57] <@%jnthnxxx> Impuso la «ley de plata o plomo», por la que muchos miembros del Gobierno, policía y militares colombianos o aceptaban la "plata" (dinero) o les caía una lluvia de "plomo" (eran asesinados a balazos).
[22:53:22] <yassir33> its a bit wired but to understand it well the best thing is to basically speak another latin language

[23:12:08] <%mrnordstrom> Not good for addicts, I guess
[23:12:50] <@%leanderb> @mrnordstrom i studied a bit of sosiologoy and it shows that the north is accepting the european drinking culture. So apparently we drink until we cant remember, and now that we've discovered the french/eropean way of drinking (drink little, but almost every day) the noth does both Kappa
[23:12:54] <@%leanderb> A glass of wine a day
[23:13:00] <@%jnthnxxx> i said i exceeded once but u know i was sleeping in a friend house and just wake up to throw up, not like i was wasted or something LUL

[23:13:49] <yassir33> depends of the age leander
[23:14:01] <@%leanderb> mrnordstrom so instead of drinking ourslef shitfaces(which is customary in the north) we now also do a glass of wine every day LUL best of both world 4Head

[23:14:08] <yassir33> adults who work can do this but when u're student etc u cant
[23:14:29] <yassir33> under 24 25 most of the people in france drink a lot on friday saturday
[23:14:42] <yassir33> and thursday if they're not busy
[23:14:47] <@%leanderb> @yassir33 in the north its called the "french way" cos u consume little alcohol but more often, while in the nordic or baltic islands u drink rarely but get shitfaced every time
[23:14:48] <@%leanderb> LUL
[23:14:54] <@%jnthnxxx> pleople here say that a glass of wine a day its healthy
[23:15:08] <yassir33> ohhh ok XD
[23:15:11] <%mrnordstrom> Antioxidants and stuff in wine
[23:15:25] <@%leanderb> jnthnxxx research shows a glass of wine every 2 weeks is healthy.... we say the same thing here, tho no one does it LUL
[23:15:34] <@%jnthnxxx> i prefer juice then, i hate the taste of alcohol tbh
[23:15:46] <@%jnthnxxx> wine champagne beer... (puke)
[23:15:59] <@%leanderb> but we do get shitfaced on weekends to the point were we cant walk, id prefer drinking regularly to getting shitfaced every weekend tbh
[23:16:12] <%mrnordstrom> It would prob be kinda hard for me to do "one glass" per day, unwise to start that habit :P
[23:16:22] <@%jnthnxxx> i dont really get that tho, its really funny? or its just an habit?
[23:16:47] <@%leanderb> jnthnxxx how about beer? i used to hate it until i turned 22. Now ive gotten used to it LUL before i hated the taste aswell, i just did shots of pure LUL
[23:17:01] <@%leanderb> jnthnxxx drinking culture
[23:17:25] <yassir33> but in north when u drink do u drink like the whole glass in 1 time or u take time to apreciate ?

[00:34:40] <%mrnordstrom> Usually I notice who hasn't been online for a while, after a few days. ;) But I cleaned up my list and removed like 75% of people so I have very few now, doubt anyone cheated.
[00:35:38] <@%jnthnxxx> my list is clean

[00:35:49] <%mrnordstrom> Nice
[00:35:49] <@+^Nightbot> ℳℰℳℰS
[00:38:08] <%mrnordstrom> I've never understood cheating, why people think it's fun. I mean I could see why pros would, just as athletes do, despicable but you get why they did it. Money etc. but casual cheaters, I don't get it. Maybe they think it's fun to piss people off.
[00:38:31] <%mrnordstrom> If there is no challenge, I don't see how it's enjoyable.
[00:39:48] <@%jnthnxxx> and no recent bans in my lasts games VisLaud

[22:57:52] <yassir33> i hate 64 tick as well
[22:58:31] <%mrnordstrom> Like, I hear the shot, and I stand still, aiming right on his head. But he headshots me with an AK. After I seemingly blow his head off.
[22:58:37] <yassir33> i shot someone with awp right in the stomach and when he killed me i saw the bullet right behind him

[22:59:42] <%mrnordstrom> Cuz friends don't wanna pay to play.
[22:59:45] <yassir33> to get the rank i think
[22:59:59] <yassir33> ESEA was first created to train a bit like u get higher level with it
[23:00:06] PART: Emtecyyy
[23:00:19] <%mrnordstrom> Yes
[23:00:59] <yassir33> ill start ESEA when i'll be LEM i think
[23:01:27] <yassir33> i need my new PC and then when i have money i can get this ESEA cide
[23:01:31] <yassir33> code
[23:01:46] <%mrnordstrom> Sounds reasonable. I'm LEM, ESEA works fine. Was so close to supreme and then I get a damn leaver in match, nice nice.
[23:02:04] <yassir33> yesterday i played 5 games
[23:02:10] <yassir33> had to surrend cuz of that 3 times !!!
[23:02:16] <%mrnordstrom> I have a bunch of ESEA codes I can give away, lemme know if you want one later
[23:02:19] <%mrnordstrom> Yea
[23:02:20] <yassir33> that was anoying :(

[23:02:50] <yassir33> dont want to be a problem for my allies
[23:03:03] <%mrnordstrom> Yea sounds a bit low
[23:03:23] <%mrnordstrom> I had about 80-120 before I ruined my laptop
[23:03:28] <yassir33> i've been on several streams and every player i asked said the idel was 150 200
[23:03:36] <%mrnordstrom> 60 hz sucks dick as well
[23:03:49] <yassir33> ye ... i ll get a 144 at the same time
[23:04:14] <%mrnordstrom> Myea I'd say 200, above that you won't really notice a difference. Unless you get sudden drops, those can be noticable.

[23:04:34] <yassir33> ye i think drops are a problem
[23:04:41] <@%leanderb> from 90 and above adding phrames has less than 0.1 effect LUL
[23:04:46] <@%leanderb> %
[23:04:51] <%mrnordstrom> A good PC for CS isn't expensive tho, don't need much of a GPU, only a decent CPU

[23:05:05] <yassir33> i have the 55 FPS and when u smoke me i drop to 20 or 30
[23:05:15] <%mrnordstrom> Jesus
[23:05:25] <@%leanderb> mrnordstrom, like, you cant meassure it. So they say ud notice less than 0.1 percent
[23:05:28] <@%leanderb> because science says
[23:05:43] <@%leanderb> eyes cant do more than 90.120 but we talking low light special settings 1 object focus
[23:05:44] <yassir33> ye but reflex lyies on FPS
[23:05:57] <@%leanderb> 120 under special, 90 normal circumstance
[23:06:05] <%mrnordstrom> leanderb Science says that, but one has to consider other things as well, not just eyes. Input lag for example. Interpolation.

[23:06:20] JOIN: Aizenml
[23:06:28] <yassir33> ye thats why FPS are allowed to go to more than 300
[23:06:41] <@%leanderb> mrnordstrom, the input lag is handled by showing disturbing images, so that the reaction would be instant
[23:06:42] <%mrnordstrom> And under 144 isn't very nice if you have 144hz
[23:06:47] <@%leanderb> kinda like a lie detector test
[23:06:57] <yassir33> but everyone told me with a new PC and though good FPS i would get quickly better skill
[23:07:02] <%mrnordstrom> I should try setting fps_max 90, see how it goes
[23:07:06] <@%leanderb> they show u more than 90 phrames u cant comprehend what u just saw
[23:07:06] <%mrnordstrom> Interesting
[23:07:15] <@%leanderb> retell it, and ur body didnt give off stress fear or anger
[23:07:27] <%mrnordstrom> Very interesting
[23:07:32] <@%leanderb> those are the responses used when ur testing for input limits as they're near instant and prdy easy to produce
[23:07:39] <@%leanderb> Now i dont know shit about eyes LUL
[23:08:06] <%mrnordstrom> yassir33 A lot of people say that, but imo it's more about it being way more fun to play on 400 fps than 55. Everything feels better, then you play better. More feeling than skill.
[23:08:08] <@%leanderb> But i do know testing LUL
[23:08:16] <@%leanderb> I agree tho
[23:08:17] <%mrnordstrom> I gotta research that

[23:15:43] <@%leanderb> yassir33, no

[23:16:36] <@%leanderb> mrnordstrom, well ur doctor probably prescribed correctly, you shuld take it :L
[23:16:40] <yassir33> but why do u talk it ?
[23:16:45] <@%leanderb> It is used for inflamatory muscles LUL
[23:16:51] <yassir33> take*
[23:17:05] <%mrnordstrom> Nah the paracetamol is useless. The aspirin I have to take though because it is a blood thinner, not because of the pain relief.
[23:17:23] <%mrnordstrom> Apparently with a replaced heart valve, you gotta take aspirin for the rest of your life
[23:17:33] <yassir33> ohhh ok
[23:17:45] <%mrnordstrom> Biological heart valve. I chose between that and a mechanical one. 
[23:17:45] <@%leanderb> mrnordstrom, But aspirin reacts with paracetamol. Well im not gonna meddle. LUL as long as they're not prescribed together u guchi
[23:18:05] <yassir33> my friends father has a peacemaker but hes not force to take that all the time if i remember
[23:18:22] <@%leanderb> ...
[23:18:32] <@%leanderb> peacemaker does not = heart valve LUL
[23:18:42] <%mrnordstrom> With a mechanical valve, it would work for the rest of my life but I'd have to take stronger meds. With the biological heart valve from a fucking cow or something, I just gotta take aspirin but I have to replace it again in 5-15 years
[23:19:12] <@%leanderb> Yeah i was just gonna ask if they could transplant that for life :O
[23:19:29] <%mrnordstrom> Wonder how my chest is gonna look after they've split it wide open 3-4 times LUL
[23:19:30] <yassir33> well im not very good at medicinal stuff XD i just learn from my friends who study it

[23:20:23] <%mrnordstrom> Not human one, it's from a "kalv", like a cow, whatever it is in English, and you gotta change it every once in a while.
[23:20:26] <yassir33> they're trying to make sort of OGM pigs for transplantation
[23:20:42] <%mrnordstrom> Mechanical would be pretty cool tho, like a cyborg, Deus Ex, augmented human :P
[23:21:31] <@%leanderb> mrnordstrom, its kalv in norwegian aswell. hm, thats interesting. Mechanical and ill start calling u mr Terminator LUL
[23:21:37] <%mrnordstrom> :D

[23:21:48] <%mrnordstrom> Heheh
[23:21:53] <yassir33> mechanical is more dangerous righT?
[23:21:54] <yassir33> wait
[23:22:13] <yassir33> i have to find u a link in my city they transplanted a full artificial heart
[23:22:21] <%mrnordstrom> I don't know what's more dangerous tbh, but mechanical needed more medical "maintenance" so I went for the biological
[23:22:21] <yassir33> for the first time
[23:22:35] <@%leanderb> yassir33, no doctor will transplant a full heart if its not needed

[23:23:22] <@%leanderb> and im like HEY SwiftRage THATS A MANS INSIDES UR FUCKING UP LUL
[23:23:24] <%mrnordstrom> Cuz they need to stop the heart and insert tubes to circulate the blood while they operate. Looks super awful.
[23:23:27] <@%leanderb> then the man wakes up all fine LUL
[23:23:30] <%mrnordstrom> Hah

[23:25:34] <@%leanderb> @yassir33, thats in french LUL
[23:25:34] <yassir33> well its in french but there's a picture a bit below of the heart

[23:25:51] <%mrnordstrom> Needles in the arteries instead of the venes, that hurts
[23:26:16] <%mrnordstrom> They gave me mizazolam, boom, out
[23:26:20] <%mrnordstrom> midazolam
[23:26:23] <yassir33> just look at the image of the heart then it speaks better than the whole text
[23:26:24] <@%leanderb> @mrnordstrom, damn dude, thats good. I thought u might have to be awake so they could check on u, then again its the heart. If they fuck up pulse is gonna go away LUL

[23:27:42] <@%leanderb> i cant even imagine
[23:28:14] <%mrnordstrom> I read that with dangerous surgeries like heart surgery, they don't wanna give you too much anesthesia because it's dangerous.
[23:28:26] <%mrnordstrom> So it could happen
[23:28:50] <@%leanderb> Time to get a pretty doctor to look at LUL

[23:29:02] <@%leanderb> Something to easy your mind LUL
[23:29:22] <@%leanderb> yassir33, i cant read anything about why it was done or how, but the fact that they did it is awesome LUL
[23:29:28] <yassir33> my mom got surgery for her feets and they had to control the anestesia cuz of her pressure
[23:29:46] <yassir33> ye they did it
[23:30:04] <yassir33> this is an old one there was a better one in my city which's worked well
[23:30:07] <@%leanderb> It was first done in 1982 tho

[23:30:41] <@%leanderb> mrnordstrom, fuck man, how did you take to waking up to that?
[23:30:58] <@%leanderb> I dont mean to be like FUCK MAN UGLY, but it must have been quite a shock! PogChamp
[23:31:49] <%mrnordstrom> mrnordstrom It was alright, I mean they're super nice and competent and tell you exactly what is gonna happen. When I woke up there were still two tubes connected to those scars at the top of the image. Like 1 dm into my intestines, they pulled them out later. That was fun.

[23:32:39] <%mrnordstrom> And they had some kinda wire connected to the heart, that would give it a little kick start of the heart rythm was irregular, which it was sometimes

[23:34:01] <@%leanderb> if my sleep apnea gets to bad, i get a machine
[23:34:03] <yassir33> no sleep apnea is easier to cure u just sleep with a thing that assists u breathin
[23:34:05] <%mrnordstrom> My dad has sleep apnea, gonna have to get oxygen and shit when he sleeps
[23:34:09] <@%leanderb> In the mean time i risk dying when i sleep LUL

[23:35:30] <@%leanderb> yassir33, sleep apnea isnt cured, u would always need the machine :p
[23:35:30] <%mrnordstrom> I got oxygen and shit the first month or so at the hospital, not fun to need it
[23:35:47] <yassir33> he got the machine 3 or 4 years ago and now he can sleep sometimes without it
[23:35:48] <@%leanderb> mrnordstrom, yeah no i've tried it. I feel bad u had to sleep with that for a whole month :/
[23:36:31] <%mrnordstrom> But those fucking cunts also had this large mash they strapped to my head and I couldn't remove it myself. It made my throat and lips so fucking dry I fucking panicked, but the intensive care assholes wouldn't take it off.

[23:56:38] <yassir33> 1m80 88 kgs
[23:56:49] <yassir33> and he did it but it didnt work
[23:56:52] <@%leanderb> Better low than too much
[23:56:59] <yassir33> ye
[23:57:05] <@%leanderb> mrnordstrom, how u doing now btw? How was the morphine withdraw? :/
[23:57:15] <@%leanderb> Ive heard it hits like a fucking truck
[23:57:47] <yassir33> but well i woke up at 11: 30 40 and after 1 hour and a half in my room the doctor said i could go
[23:58:04] <yassir33> but i was hiiiiigh after this XD
[23:58:06] <@%leanderb> that was quick, LUL
[23:58:08] <%mrnordstrom> I'm all good, only taking aspirin as blood thinner, no narcotics. :) Yeah I mean, I was on a ton of morphine for years, my doctor said she was surprised I could even stand up straight. But
[23:58:09] <@%leanderb> hahahaha
[23:58:11] <@%leanderb> i can imagine LUL
[23:58:36] <yassir33> well at least u can play u can move talk etc
[23:58:41] <yassir33> its nice btw SeemsGood
[23:58:57] <yassir33> u can do everything i do or leander does
[23:58:58] <%mrnordstrom> They switched me from morphine to oxy after the surgery, then they kinda weaned me off slowly for 2-3 months. So it didn't hit me that much, but I know withdrawals, they are worse than nightmare.
[23:59:25] <@%leanderb> mrnordstrom, haha! We gave a lady thats notoriously difficult to work with 3 doses of horse tranquilizers. Im not kidding. This is used on big ass horses, but she was so resitant the doctor told ur to give her one dose. She took 3. And was walking around being happy singing LUL
[23:59:38] <%mrnordstrom> Hahah
[00:00:09] <%mrnordstrom> I've had opiate withdrawal where you can't sleep for days and it hurts so fucking much it's insane. It's all in your head but it doesn't matter.
[00:00:11] <yassir33> XD
[00:00:17] <%mrnordstrom> You can't lie still for 10 seconds
[00:00:20] <@%leanderb> Sometimes u just cant calculate LUL so now we cant take her to the hospital cos she cant sleep.... cos we cant put anything more in her without risking her life.. which we apparently did by tripling her dose LUL
[00:00:29] <%mrnordstrom> Damn haha
[00:00:38] <@%leanderb> mrnordstrom, ouff
[00:00:41] <@%leanderb> thats sounds like hell
[00:00:53] <%mrnordstrom> Yea
[00:00:54] <%mrnordstrom> Def
[00:01:02] <@%leanderb> I mean ive tried a lot of things that will give you heavy withdrawl
[00:01:06] <@%leanderb> and ive gone mental
[00:01:14] <%mrnordstrom> But most often it's self inflicted so you can't really feel sorry for yourself hehe
[00:01:17] <@%leanderb> i cant imagine opiate withdrawl

[00:04:23] <yassir33> or 400 depends
[00:04:48] <yassir33> and i can tell ya psychologist arent all equal now :/
[00:04:52] <@%leanderb> In norway you have to have 5.8 out of 6 grade average to take the one line in oslo that gives you the title psychologist
[00:05:00] <%mrnordstrom> Damn, that's nice
[00:05:17] <@%leanderb> You can take a master in psychology, but ur not a psychologist unless u do the 1 course on that school LUL
[00:05:17] <yassir33> 5,8 is high ! O_o
[00:05:32] <@%leanderb> yassir33, well thats cos the best students in the country wanna go there LUL
[00:05:41] <@%leanderb> And they dont wanna open more spots..
[00:05:49] <@%leanderb> To ensure psychologists are top notch LUL
[00:05:51] <MonkieTrumpet> wtf
[00:05:52] <%mrnordstrom> I am my own psychologist, I talk to myself just fine
[00:06:00] <yassir33> best students in france in scientists go in ingeneer schools
[00:06:09] <@%leanderb> mrnordstrom, here here! LUL
[00:06:15] <%mrnordstrom> :P
[00:06:18] <yassir33> then we have commercial schools for economy students
[00:06:30] <yassir33> and for litterature it depends
[00:06:37] <@%leanderb> I think ive actually treated the anxiety attacks i got after i broke up with my ex LUL
[00:06:46] <%mrnordstrom> I can talk to Nina, she is a semi-doctor
[00:06:53] <@%leanderb> True dat LUL
[00:07:17] <yassir33> well psychologist i dont trust that much in them :/
[00:07:27] <@%leanderb> yassir33, same here, except the last few years psychology is the hardest thing to get into LUL
[00:07:31] <yassir33> think friends are better psychologists sometimes
[00:07:44] <%mrnordstrom> Well, they kept pushing me to see one, but I mean I know what they're gonna say. Could be interesting tho.
[00:07:48] <%mrnordstrom> Friends, yes
[00:08:12] <yassir33> my school sent me twice
[00:08:15] <%mrnordstrom> I have an addiction personality bla bla, I'm probably both borderline and bipolar :P
[00:08:40] <yassir33> once at the age of 13 cuz i had some problems with people in my class and i threatened them etc like i fought with them
[00:08:47] <@%leanderb> like in borderline borderline? LUL
[00:08:53] <%mrnordstrom> LUL
[00:09:02] <yassir33> ye like the game Kappa
[00:09:04] <%mrnordstrom> BPD
[00:09:37] <@%leanderb> I mean tho LUL
[00:09:39] <@%leanderb> If ur borderline
[00:09:46] <yassir33> but i got sent to this fuckin thing by school twice lul
[00:09:47] <@%leanderb> u dont have an addiction personality at least LUL
[00:09:58] <%mrnordstrom> Hah
[00:10:05] <@%leanderb> They'd just throw that under borderline anyways LUL
[00:10:08] <yassir33> no addiction to it MingLee
[00:10:11] <%mrnordstrom> yassir33 If they mess with you, you fuck them up, ez
[00:10:24] <yassir33> no just like last year it became serious
[00:10:29] <%mrnordstrom> leanderb, True :P
[00:10:54] <yassir33> first time it was normal for everyone and it was cool cuz i ended scool at 11h30 instead of 17h00
[00:11:26] <@%leanderb> mrnordstrom, i actually doubt the psychologist would use the term borderline tho. It was mostly popularized by american papers for any psycho LUL
[00:11:32] <yassir33> but 2nd time they sent me there cuz i defended my teacher against some retards i really wanted to crush and i just threatened his life
[00:11:42] <%mrnordstrom> True, it's a very catch-all diagnosis
[00:11:48] <%mrnordstrom> If it is a diagnosis at all
[00:11:49] <@%leanderb> yeah for sure :p
[00:12:07] <yassir33> well their diagnosis are always the same

[00:13:35] <yassir33> i got expelled 4 times, once a year during 4 years but not definitely
[00:13:40] <%mrnordstrom> I was at IT high school where we each got a free laptop and had it during class. Some shitfaces fucked with friends of ours so we hacked their CS clan website. It was in the newspaper. :(
[00:13:46] <yassir33> and they sent me twice there
[00:13:54] <@%leanderb> mrnordstrom, hahahah LUL thats awesome tho LUL
[00:14:20] <yassir33> XD nord
[00:14:23] <@%leanderb> yassir33, the only reason i was ever almost expelled was cos i was 84% away from class one year LUL
[00:14:35] <@%leanderb> I got sent home a lot.. or to the principle...
[00:14:43] <@%leanderb> never threatened to be moved to another school LUL
[00:14:44] <%mrnordstrom> Had to see the principal a few times. Once I set up an SSH tunnel and proxy at home, connected to it at school, and could browse anything, some shit they tried to block. English teacher cought us watching porn during class. Encrypted, LUL
[00:14:47] <yassir33> i got expelled every time cuz i was fighting
[00:15:04] <@%leanderb> Then again we were 6/40 norwegians, in a norwegian school. Mby they couldnt remove me LUL
[00:15:11] <%mrnordstrom> Hah damn

[00:15:20] <%mrnordstrom> caught*
[00:15:20] <yassir33> oh yea and once they expelled me cuz police wanted to catch me in school so the headmaster said no and when he saw me he noticed 2 days for that

[00:37:30] <yassir33> cuz my friend does webdesigning and graphic design at school but they dont learn how to code
[00:37:31] <@%leanderb> yeah i can see the github

[00:37:42] <@%leanderb> but what da fuq does polestart do

[00:39:08] <yassir33> ?
[00:39:13] <%mrnordstrom> leanderb It loads for example articles for a blog or pages for a website, stored in a GH repository. So you could use GitHub Pages to host a site instead of needing web hosting, VPS, whatever. No server side at all necessary but you can still split things into several markdown posts and it loads on the site.

[00:39:50] <@%leanderb> yassir33 what on earth is c4d and pcs6?
[00:39:57] <%mrnordstrom> leanderb It's kinda useless though because SEO doesn't work so well if the content is dynamically loaded with JS. Just did it for fun, to see how few lines of code I could do it in. Minimal. Opposite of what you talked about with reddit. :P

[00:41:12] <%mrnordstrom> Well then he does design yeah, not development. But it's good for front-end designers to know basics of code, even if it's not necessary. They can send photoshop files to a front-end dev, but it's optimal if they know how it will actually be turned into HTML and CSS.

[16:57:35] <%mrnordstrom> It's pretty neat. Decent for deagling for me, but it just somehow feels a bit slower than lower res, I dont know why, just a feeling.
[16:59:00] <%mrnordstrom> 800 feels so smoth for some reason. 1024 great as well. I used 1920 for a while, which technically should be better since you get more detail, but it just feels off and I played like shit.

[17:29:49] <%mrnordstrom> GTR switched to black bars I believe, and pyth plays BB since he awps a lot. But the rest may be on stretched, not sure. At least they used to be.
[17:29:55] <%mrnordstrom> I just don't get why hehe
[17:30:01] <@%+ファイサル> i play at 720p
[17:30:28] <%mrnordstrom> 16:9?

[17:30:36] <%mrnordstrom> Makes sense
[17:30:59] <@%+ファイサル> i did it cause its streaming friendly tbh lol
[17:31:01] <@%+ファイサル> but like

[17:32:34] <@%leanderb> i gues LUL
[17:32:42] <%mrnordstrom> Many NA players do 16:9
[17:32:51] <%mrnordstrom> And 1080p
[17:32:55] <%mrnordstrom> Maybe for streaming, idk
[17:33:01] <@%leanderb> tbh i think its more preference
[17:33:15] <%mrnordstrom> yznb, the NiP streamer, has everything on high and 1080p, he plays really well on it.
[17:33:17] <@%jnthnxxx> 1.6 eagle > FeelsBadMan
[17:33:47] <%mrnordstrom> But then you see like pyth and s1mple going with 800x600 still heh

[17:34:29] <%mrnordstrom> Don't think it actually matters much tbh, sometimes you feel kinda off and gotta change something.

[17:43:30] <%mrnordstrom> Yep chatty is pretty sweet
[17:43:35] <@%leanderb> samme command doe, it just has issues LUL
[17:43:38] <@%jnthnxxx> ye i wisp ppl thru chatty
[17:43:48] <@%jnthnxxx> i didnt have any :/ idk
[17:43:58] <%mrnordstrom> I gotta build my own client, this is not pretty enough :P
[17:44:02] <%mrnordstrom> Java, ew
[17:44:29] <@%jnthnxxx> ye buildin me own client with rubi BrokeBack
[17:44:41] <%mrnordstrom> JavaScript ;) 
[17:44:48] <@%jnthnxxx> ye that too
[17:45:20] <%mrnordstrom> IRC, should be simple enough, just gotta check out how the whispers actually work but that should be in the API I guess
[17:45:31] <%mrnordstrom> I remember I used to connect to IRC using telnet heh
[17:45:38] <%mrnordstrom> Raw commands
[17:45:41] <@%jnthnxxx> wats the issue with whispers tho?
[17:45:58] <%mrnordstrom> They work differently from direct messages in IRC protocol
[17:46:01] <@%leanderb> Twitch builds on top of irv
[17:46:03] <@%leanderb> irc
[17:46:04] <%mrnordstrom> idk how they actually work
[17:46:08] <@%leanderb> Whispers arent irc LUL
[17:46:12] <%mrnordstrom> Chat is entirely IRC based but not whispers hehe
[17:46:21] <@%leanderb> So there are issues, especially when twitch does updates. But they are rare
[17:46:29] JOIN: Tedo7177
[17:46:33] <@%leanderb> Then again chatty warns us whispers might fail LUL
[17:46:38] <@%leanderb> so its not activated by standard
[17:46:48] <@%jnthnxxx> maybe i didnt notice them but i always being able to whisp ppl and stuff
[17:46:55] <@%leanderb> ye usually its fine
[17:47:03] <@%leanderb> ive had a few times where ive gotten 0 messages
[17:47:10] <@%leanderb> then the backlog comes in once chatty runs an update
[17:47:34] <@%leanderb> wich is weird
[17:47:37] <@%jnthnxxx> oooooh maybe im not enough popular PuppeyFace
[17:47:43] <@%jnthnxxx> so i didnt notice it

[17:55:31] <@%leanderb> They might tell u win 10 is not beta, but trust me. Its the biggest public beta forced on people in history. Huge driver issues, backwards compatability, i mean 90% of nvidias graphic cards arent really compatibal with it. Its like u get half of what u should out of it LUL

[00:57:50] <@leanderb> ^
[00:58:04] <%mrnordstrom> Just leave it, please :)
[00:58:06] <yassir33> a wild false leanderb
[00:58:25] <bigfatgator> yassir this is great leasson for you about attachment
[00:58:30] <bigfatgator> Everything good comes to an end
[00:58:33] <bigfatgator> And everyone you love will die
[00:58:43] <yassir33> i know it XD
[00:58:44] <bigfatgator> And then you die
[00:58:49] <yassir33> but i hope i'll die before them
[00:58:54] <bigfatgator> And then its total darkness
[00:58:57] <bigfatgator> And then Jesus comes
[00:58:57] <%mrnordstrom> What is this discussion
[00:58:58] <yassir33> hope they'll have a long life
[00:59:14] <bigfatgator> And then Jesus shows you the light
[00:59:23] <bigfatgator> And then you can choose to turn it on or off
[00:59:29] <yassir33> well anyways nothin to do with this wallin's chat and stream is about hapiness and stuff
[00:59:44] <yassir33> i completely agree with u on this dude
[00:59:58] <bigfatgator> Im just saying, probably not a good to get to attacheed to someone streaming on twitch, chances are she probaly wont even stream in 5 years
[01:00:20] <%mrnordstrom> Maybe we should not speculate
[01:00:28] <yassir33> well gator i like the person and the player
[01:00:34] <yassir33> we shouldnt speculate
[01:00:36] <bigfatgator> I ment like in general Nordström
[01:00:46] <bigfatgator> meant
[01:00:47] <%mrnordstrom> Yeh I get the lesson :)
[01:00:57] <%mrnordstrom> True
[01:00:58] <yassir33> but when i see flist and i see everyone playin
[01:01:24] <yassir33> i spectate sometimes for example i spectate my friendlist not only nina i watch how they do in game
[01:01:26] <@%jnthnxxx> im gonna say this, nina likes offline chat as a general thing, not something focused on her
[01:01:33] <@%jnthnxxx> its normal to talk to her or about her if shes streaming
[01:01:34] <yassir33> and im proud of them ALL the time thats beautiful
[01:01:40] <@%jnthnxxx> but u guys sometimes look like u r obsessed
[01:01:50] <bigfatgator> Pretty rare to be arouind 30 and not have kid on the way or at least boyfriend with established real life. Not the way she has to live by any means, but MOST women in Sweden tend to lean towards that way sooner or later.
[01:01:55] <%mrnordstrom> Just chillerino in the chatterino
[01:02:15] <bigfatgator> All about that Kärnfamilj, välfärd and villa volvo vovve
[01:03:00] <bigfatgator> Catches up to everyone sooner or lateer
[01:03:22] <yassir33> ye i know that its the same as everywhere but i mean that i'm not only here to watch nina i speak with u as well thats why im here when she's hostin games i wanna watch
[01:03:30] <bigfatgator> Not even sure Twitch will be a thing in 5 years
[01:03:37] <bigfatgator> Not even talking about Nina anymore
[01:03:43] <bigfatgator> About streaming and twitch in general
[01:03:53] <@%jnthnxxx> something else will appear
[01:03:59] <@%jnthnxxx> or maybe twitch evolve
[01:04:02] <@%jnthnxxx> who knows
[01:04:03] <bigfatgator> There has already been like 2 other sites just like twitch before twitch
[01:04:03] <%mrnordstrom> It will be here, but it may be different
[01:04:06] <%mrnordstrom> New shit
[01:04:08] <yassir33> oh ye but well i dont get on well that much with all streams u know
[01:04:11] <%mrnordstrom> Innovations
[01:04:15] <%mrnordstrom> VR, whatever.
[01:04:18] <@%jnthnxxx> well justin.tv its twitch
[01:04:22] <%mrnordstrom> Yeah
[01:04:30] <@%jnthnxxx> and own3d have some financial problems
[01:04:37] <@%jnthnxxx> didnt pay the streamers and stuff
[01:04:38] <yassir33> i have 3 or 4 streamers i really enjoy watchin
[01:04:49] <bigfatgator> Ye i remember when i started watching league of legends streams
[01:04:49] <yassir33> nina's the first one XD
[01:04:53] <%mrnordstrom> I have a ton of streams
[01:04:55] <bigfatgator> That was own3d right?
[01:04:56] <%mrnordstrom> That I watch
[01:04:59] <@%jnthnxxx> ye
[01:05:04] <yassir33> owned ?
[01:05:07] <@%jnthnxxx> own3d with hotshotgg
[01:05:11] <bigfatgator> Yees
[01:05:13] <yassir33> the old website was owned?
[01:05:16] <yassir33> ok ok

[01:05:27] <@%jnthnxxx> :O
[01:05:32] <@%jnthnxxx> ye i guessed rn
[01:05:39] <@%jnthnxxx> when i type his nick
[01:05:40] <@%jnthnxxx> LUL
[01:05:40] <bigfatgator> He was such a beast
[01:05:46] <bigfatgator> Held top 2 in NA
[01:05:50] <bigfatgator> With two accounts lol
[01:05:55] <bigfatgator> 1 and 2
[01:06:10] <@%jnthnxxx> ive never get into LoL tho, just lurking streams and chill there
[01:06:11] <bigfatgator> Ye i found his stream like a year ago or something
[01:06:16] <@%jnthnxxx> having them as a background sound
[01:06:18] <bigfatgator> He lives with a lot of cats now and just has around 50 viewers
[01:06:32] <@%jnthnxxx> a year ago? i think it was like 3 years ago
[01:06:36] <bigfatgator> I met him at dreamhack
[01:06:40] <@%jnthnxxx> VisLaud
[01:06:44] <bigfatgator> Yes but a year ago was when i found him
[01:06:58] <bigfatgator> Must have been 2010 or 2011
[01:07:00] <yassir33> i have to tell ya something about that as well =) i really believe nina can be in a pro team she has everything to be a pro and maybe i just say maybe cuz this is not sure but she could maybe be a part of the first mix CS GO team
[01:07:05] <bigfatgator> Dreamhack, big LoL tournament
[01:07:05] <yassir33> or one of thoses
[01:07:13] <@%jnthnxxx> bigfatjiji i dont remember why he changed his nicknamem :thinking:
[01:07:25] <bigfatgator> means dick in chinese
[01:07:29] <bigfatgator> If thats what you are thinking about?
[01:07:41] <@%jnthnxxx> yes jajjajja
[01:07:45] <bigfatgator> jiji = penus
[01:07:46] <@%jnthnxxx> maybe the website told him
[01:07:47] <@%jnthnxxx> something
[01:07:48] <@%jnthnxxx> idk
[01:07:49] <bigfatgator> ye
[01:07:54] <@leanderb> bigfatgator how much did u have to drink?
[01:07:56] <@leanderb> LUL
[01:08:01] <bigfatgator> What
[01:08:21] <@leanderb> [01:01:48] bigfatgator: Pretty rare to be arouind 30 and not have kid on the way or at least boyfriend with established real life. Not the way she has to live by any means, but MOST women in Sweden tend to lean towards that way sooner or later.
[01:08:35] <bigfatgator> Im just saying thats the way it is in Sweden
[01:08:53] <bigfatgator> Probably Norway to, when you get around 30, look at your facebook with old classmates and people from your old school
[01:08:56] <@leanderb> i thought nina was closer to 20 than 30
[01:08:58] <bigfatgator> Like, 80% has kids.. not even kidding
[01:09:05] <@%jnthnxxx> ye 23
[01:09:10] <yassir33> well like in most of the countries
[01:09:42] <yassir33> the european dream is about that to be accomplished idk how we say it good u have to be a parent at some point in europe
[01:09:45] <@leanderb> bigfatgatorim not disputing that people settle down, i just think ur thinking a bit down the road LUL
[01:09:51] <bigfatgator> Im around 30 and if i look up people from my old highschool its probably around 90% with kids, cars and houses
[01:09:56] <yassir33> in america its different they dont mind that much about that
[01:10:06] <bigfatgator> leander i talked about in 5 years from now
[01:10:16] PART: OfficialScrap

[01:11:01] <pleanderb> it might die in 5 years LUL
[01:11:01] <bigfatgator> Just saying how much can change in 5 years and that you shouldnt get attached to something like this.. If Nina stopped streaming tomorrow i would be sad yes ofc but at the same time life would go on.
[01:11:10] <@leanderb> didnt i ban you? DansGame
[01:11:14] <bigfatgator> Ye i use the same logic lol

[01:14:32] <yassir33> really this stream is about talent i think i dont watch it that much for ninas face or what i dont care about that nina is nina the thing that is interesting is her gameplay
[01:15:21] <bigfatgator> yassir33 Yeah Nina is really good.. but its so much more then just tallent to be a good pro
[01:15:26] <yassir33> even if she's nina well we like her hair etc but its not all about that =) hope u guys have a good night i have to sleep cya everyone <3
[01:15:27] <bigfatgator> Its a lot of hard work

[01:17:56] <bigfatgator> Maybe he thinks its fun when hes on LAN and win big games
[01:18:08] <bigfatgator> But when he wakes up and has to DM for 2 hours , thats not fun
[01:18:10] <@leanderb> bigfatgator i couldnt imagine sitting thru some of the korean regimes. you play 12 hours a day 8 hours sleep 1 hour food 3 hours off
[01:18:14] <@leanderb> every other weekend off in league

[01:26:10] <bigfatgator> jnthnxxx : Cant belive Optic has a house like that and there CS go team isnt even top 20

[01:27:32] <bigfatgator> I cant even begin to imagine how many of those big mansions where built in the USA
[01:27:46] <bigfatgator> I guess all the people who made good money on IT and stocks are behind it..
[01:28:15] <@%jnthnxxx> being born in a rich family... FeelsBadMan ez life
[01:28:56] <@leanderb> are you shitting me?
[01:29:00] <@leanderb> how on earth
[01:29:01] <@leanderb> did optic
[01:29:04] <@leanderb> afford that
[01:29:12] <@leanderb> 50 year down payment? LUL
[01:29:17] <@%jnthnxxx> cod tournaments give a lot of money i guess
[01:29:19] <@%jnthnxxx> u now
[01:29:25] <@%jnthnxxx> EA, publicity
[01:29:27] <@%jnthnxxx> and stuff
[01:29:40] <bigfatgator> They can probably sell it for just as much as they bought it leanderb
[01:29:43] <bigfatgator> If not more
[01:29:56] <@leanderb> Yeah thats true
[01:30:01] <@leanderb> might just be an investment from the company
[01:30:12] <bigfatgator> You buy it and take a huge hit for it but in 5-10 years its paid off
[01:30:13] <@leanderb> but damn, optic must still be hella secure financially
[01:30:23] <@%jnthnxxx> maybe its rented?
[01:30:37] <@leanderb> i mean the maintanance costs alone sound huge LUL
[01:30:51] <bigfatgator> What e-sports team do they have
[01:30:55] <bigfatgator> cos in CS go they suck?
[01:31:03] <bigfatgator> Never heard them win any big tournaments
[01:31:05] <@%jnthnxxx> optic and faze with the cod and the sponsors probably make a ton of money
[01:31:07] JOIN: Padsland90
[01:31:12] <@%jnthnxxx> optic and faze r the best cod teams
[01:31:23] <bigfatgator> Still..
[01:31:40] <bigfatgator> Must be hard to have several e-sports team and just have 1 of them generate income
[01:31:55] <bigfatgator> That cant be a winning business plan
[01:32:02] <@leanderb> yeah they're big cod teams
[01:32:03] <@%jnthnxxx> cod

[01:32:30] <bigfatgator> You get all the benefits as the COD guys gets; same big house
[01:32:35] <bigfatgator> Probably same paycheck
[01:32:39] <bigfatgator> But you dont have to perform
[01:32:45] <bigfatgator> And noone cares if you win

[23:11:48] <%mrnordstrom> Even for top 5 teams
[23:12:13] <yassir33> ya but SK has lost a bit of its power i guess :/
[23:12:18] <%mrnordstrom> They have
[23:12:30] <%mrnordstrom> But they're still sick :P
[23:12:31] <yassir33> i mean since they got 16 0'd i dont hear about them
[23:12:34] <%mrnordstrom> Yep
[23:12:37] <%mrnordstrom> Awful
[23:12:52] <yassir33> ye coldzera is one of the best players in the world he can play any role i think
[23:12:52] <%mrnordstrom> But I think FalleN and the boys are working hard to get back
[23:13:25] <yassir33> i heard that falleN was one of the best IGLs in the world is that true ?
[23:13:28] <%mrnordstrom> They will probably fuck everyone in this dev league tho

[23:16:23] <%mrnordstrom> Well I think they need time to work as a team
[23:16:43] <%mrnordstrom> fnatic will probably be awesome, but they need time to play and figure each other out

[23:48:13] <~%+DrWallin> where the hell do i do this
[23:48:15] <%mrnordstrom> If the bomb is suicide because you killed the bomb carrier, they will probably smoke mid doors and pick the bomb or similar. So just let them have the bomb and play 5v4, no need to push, just hold, because you have the advantage. But people don't get that, they start to push. And suddenly it's 4v4, or 4v3.
[23:48:21] <yassir33> editor nina ?
[23:48:46] <%mrnordstrom> As soon as you are 5v4, FALL BACK AND HOLD

[00:03:35] <%mrnordstrom> Cannot find any info on what happens after the blood is used, but I *seriously* doubt that you'll ever find out what it's used for. Doesn't sound like the way Swedish healthcare operates. It's most likely anonymous after they've tested it and made sure it's fine. Takes resources to make a call every time blood is used, definitely not what Swedish healthcare would do.

[00:19:54] <%mrnordstrom> Talking about swedish healthcare, yassir had heard that when they use the blood you've donated, to save someone's life, you get a phone call saying so. I don't think that's correct, can't find any info anywhere.

[00:20:00] <%mrnordstrom> Doesn't sound like swe healthcare.
[00:20:25] <@%jnthnxxx> mmmm since medical issues from people are private, and donating blood is something altruist
[00:20:33] <@%jnthnxxx> i prefer to do not have any call
[00:20:53] <@%jnthnxxx> if i donate blood, that i did a few times im fine knowing that my blood some day r goin to help someone
[00:21:01] <%mrnordstrom> Yeah exactly, it's confidential and anonymous so 
[00:21:07] <OfficialScrap> but getting a text saying you've saved a Life today, might make you feel better and donate more blood
[00:21:17] <%mrnordstrom> Found out that I can never ever donate blood here according to the rules.

[22:58:40] <%yassir33> finger tip doesnt allow u to do idk how to say that but big moves

The leaders in the EU will want to make an example of us so other countries don't start leaving and we'll be forced into accepting a deal to trade otherwise our economy will go to shit

[04:33:59] <%mrnordstrom> lol
[04:34:02] <OfficialScrap> my fault

[04:36:00] <%mrnordstrom> :D
[04:36:28] <%SupremeTerrific> Yeah, I played LoL. Maybe LoL is worse, but I'd need more experience with H1Z1 to say for sure.
[04:37:14] <OfficialScrap> i took a 5hour walk in h1z1 tonight
[04:37:17] <%SupremeTerrific> I miss the old Dota community. They were pretty toxic, but in a fun kind of way.
[04:37:20] <OfficialScrap> was lit
[04:38:02] <%SupremeTerrific> Dude, you should try DayZ. H1Z1 got me back into that. The map is fuckin' nuts.
[04:38:54] <%SupremeTerrific> I just walked from my camp in DayZ to a city in the southwest to do some trading. Spent easily six hours just getting there. I honestly don't think I'm going back. Camp's not worth it. rofl
[04:39:04] <OfficialScrap> haha
[04:41:02] <%mrnordstrom> idk people say bad things about DayZ. Can't remember what they said but I recall it being bad :P
[04:41:09] <%mrnordstrom> flusha res is pretty fucking sick tho
[04:41:09] <%SupremeTerrific> I love the community in DayZ. Plenty of toxicity on some servers, I'm sure, but there are some great groups in that game. If I tried to go to someone's base in H1Z1 to do some trading, I'd definitely get killed. Shit, if I tried to walk for six hours, I'd die ten times. Kappa
[04:41:50] <OfficialScrap> i only met one person on the walk but he had nothing and just spawned
[04:42:14] <%SupremeTerrific> Ehh, DayZ has been in development hell for a while. That's the main problem. Game's super hardcore and turns off a lot of people, I'm sure.
[04:42:37] <%SupremeTerrific> That's pretty lucky, Scrap. I attracted PvPing dicks wherever I went.
[04:42:56] <%mrnordstrom> damn I like this res, this is the shit
[04:43:02] <OfficialScrap> then i get back to the base and Nina tries to trick to go to a city and kill some noobs

[11:06:12] <%SupremeTerrific> For me, it's more than just the typical ethical thing of saving the animals. The main motivator for me is the water cost of meat and dairy production and how those industries affect the climate. I'm not going to make judgments on other people's diets, and it's up to them to make their own decisions about the ethics of it.
